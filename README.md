# Crash Log Tools for Mod Organizer

These are plugins for [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.modorganizer.org/) that provide extra functionality for the Skyrim crash logs generated by [Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59596).

## Plugins

### Crash Log Labeler
Attempts to label known functions in the call stack by looking them up from [Address Library Database](https://github.com/meh321/AddressLibraryDatabase).

When you start Mod Organizer with the plugin installed, it will pull the database and try to label any crash logs already in your log directory. If your game crashes thereafter, it will scan for a new log file and try to label it as well. If you wish to restore the original logs, they can be found in the Recycle Bin.

#### Settings
**offline_mode**  
Disables automatic updates from the remote database.

### Crash Log Viewer
Adds a GUI dialog that allows you to easily access your crash logs.

The tool can be started from the Tool Plugins menu.

## Packaging from Source
External libraries need to be acquired and installed to the `lib` subdirectory of the plugin.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SirCromy/ModOrganizer-CrashLogTools

pip install -r plugin-requirements.txt -t crashlogtools/lib
